#in python we can take user input directly by using input() function.This input function gives a return value as string/character hence we have to pass that into a variable
# a=input("my name is: ")
# print("my name is",a)
b=input("my name is {1} and i scored {0} in maths".format(90,'lavanya'))
print(b)
